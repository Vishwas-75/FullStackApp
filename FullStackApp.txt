  What Is RootQuary?
  In root quary we have to write a quary in such way that we have to access all the
  other quary.  

  Why we want wright RootQuary?
  It is writen to access all other quary
   
  What is the adantages of graphQl?
  #Single end point.
  #Avoid multiple calls.




  structure 

  const Roottype= new GraphQLQuary({
  name:"RootQuaryType",
  fields:{
    book:{
      type:BookType,
      args:{id:{type:GraphQLQuary}},
      
      resolve(parent,args)
    }
  }
}) 
args: From parent if we want access the book we need to unique id or unique attribute access it 
so we need to pass it ass args .

resolve:It is a function used to fetch the data. 

why we want define fields as a function?
Because code is excuted from top to buttom ,when we bring relation between two quary 
we need to specify the type of other quary, so if we dont declare the fields as a function it
will be executed directly, during execution it will find type and throw an error saying
ex:"BookType is not defined" or "AuthorType is not defined";

Appolo Client:

What is Appolo Client?
Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage 
both local and remote data with GraphQL. Use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while 
automatically updating your UI.

Why Appolo Client?
>Declarative data fetching.
With Apollo's declarative approach to data fetching, all of the logic for retrieving your data, tracking 
loading and error states, and updating your UI is encapsulated by the useQuery Hook.
ex:
'''
    function Feed() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS);
  if (error) return <Error />;
  if (loading || !data) return <Fetching />;

  return <DogList dogs={data.dogs} />;
  }
